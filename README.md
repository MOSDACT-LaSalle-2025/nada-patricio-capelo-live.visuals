Project Description: Music Visuals You Can Control



This project is a digital art experience that mixes music and images. When you play a song, the program listens to the music and shows different images on the screen that react to the sound, especially the bass. For example, when the beat is strong, you’ll see bursts of fire appear.



You can also use your keyboard to control what’s shown:



Press S to cover the screen with a big, colorful snake.

Press W to splash water shapes with bright, random colors and different sizes.

Press A to make smoke clouds appear in random places.

Press D to switch the background from black to white.

The images and effects change each time, so every run looks unique. The idea is to let you play with the connection between sound, color, and movement, creating your own live visuals as the music plays.
